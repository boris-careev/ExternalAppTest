# ExternalAccountsTest
External Application to test delegated web API used to view / manage FHIR Providers and Accounts

The features currently  available are:
 - Listing providers accessible to current user (now named "External Account Providers" on the user side)
 - Listing provider accounts for current user (now named "External Accounts" on the user side)
 - Refresh data (i.e. poll data) for a specific provider account
 - Delete a specific provider account (does a round trip to the host application to request user confirmation)
